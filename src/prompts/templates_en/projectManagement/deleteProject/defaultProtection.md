# 🔒 Project Deletion Not Allowed

**Project:** {{projectName}}

## Protection Notice

This project cannot be deleted due to system protection policies.

## Why This Restriction Exists

- **Active content** - Project contains tasks, plans, or important data
- **System dependency** - Other components may reference this project
- **Data safety** - Prevents accidental loss of critical project data
- **Administrative policy** - Project marked as protected by system configuration

## Alternative Actions

If you need to clean up or reorganize this project:

- **Clear tasks:** Use task management tools to remove individual tasks
- **Archive content:** Move important tasks to other projects first
- **Create new project:** Make a new project for future work
- **Reset content:** Remove tasks and plans but keep the project structure
- **Contact administrator:** Request project deletion if absolutely necessary

## Creating Alternative Projects

```
createProject("My New Project", "Description of project purpose")
```

This creates a new project that you can use for your work while preserving the protected project data.
