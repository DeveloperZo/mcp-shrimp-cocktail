# ❌ Plan Creation Failed

**Plan Name:** {{planName}}  
**Error:** {{error}}

## Common Issues

1. **Duplicate Name**: A plan with a similar name may already exist
2. **Invalid Characters**: Plan names must contain only letters, numbers, spaces, hyphens, and underscores
3. **Length Limits**: Plan names must be between 1-100 characters

## Suggestions

- Use `list_plans projectName="{{projectName}}"` to see existing plans
- Try a different plan name
- Check the error message for specific requirements

Please correct the issue and try again.
