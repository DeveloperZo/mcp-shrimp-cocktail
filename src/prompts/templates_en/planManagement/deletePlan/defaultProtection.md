# 🛡️ Plan Deletion Not Allowed

**Plan:** {{planName}}
**Project:** {{projectName}}

This plan cannot be deleted as it is protected by the system configuration.

## Plan Protection Reasons

- Contains active or important tasks
- May be referenced by other system components
- Required for current project workflow
- System administrator has restricted deletion

## What You Can Do

1. Create alternative plans for new workflows
2. Switch to a different plan: `switch_plan projectName="{{projectName}}" planName="<other-plan>"`
3. Archive or complete tasks within this plan instead of deleting
4. Contact system administrator if deletion is necessary
5. Move tasks to other plans before attempting deletion

Ensure all important data is preserved before any plan modifications.
